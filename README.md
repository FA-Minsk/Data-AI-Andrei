My experience for "R" for Data Analysis and AI
"Cyclistic Case Study - Quick Economic Research."
This is my first public case as a junior data analyst, and I will be working for a fictitious company called Cyclistic. 
As I went through the cases of other analysts, I was amazed by the numerous impressive and complex analyses that took 
into account factors such as weather, city maps, and participant behavior based on the day of the week and hour of the day. However, 
I couldn't find an answer to the main question:
What is the benefit to the company of having more members with an annual subscription? I will finally tackle this question for all!
